# Objective

Hi there, in this post I'll be explaining a way to render LaTeX Math symbols, and consequently, any formulas or expressions you want, on an Astro blog post.

We'll be taking advantage of a couple plugins to achieve this. Our end result will allow us to write something like:

```text
$f(x) = 2x$
```

to achieve $f(x) = 2x$. I think we can all agree that LaTeX typesetting's really one of the best out there, thus its popularity.

If you just want the solution, jump to [#Solution](#solution).

#### MDX Plugins

I'm assuming you already know what **MDX** is since you're here, but if you don't, it's basically markdown on steroids, allowing you to embed JS components in it.
You can read more [here](https://mdxjs.com/).

What you may not know is that it supports plugins. We care about two specific families of plugins, **remark** and **rehype**.
[**remark**](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugins allow you to transform markdown, where [**rehype**](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) transforms HTML (the final product of static page generators).

These can be installed with your node package manager, like **npm** or **pnpm**.

More information on extending **MDX** can be found [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/).

#### LaTeX plugins

To allow us to render math properly, we'll use the following plugins:

- [**rehype-katex**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex): Rehype plugin to support rendering inline math in HTML
- [**remark-math**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math): Remark plugin to support math, in the form of \$your math formula\$

# Solution

Install the plugins with:

```bash
npm install rehype-katex
npm install remark-math
```

Then, add these references to your `astro.config.ts` file, specifically to the `defineConfig` section.

```typescript
import rehypeKatex from 'rehype-katex'; // relevant
import remarkMath from 'remark-math';   // relevant

export default defineConfig({
	markdown: {
		shikiConfig: {
			theme: "dracula",
			wrap: false,
		}
	},
	site: "https://mcaramalho.com",
	integrations: [
		mdx({
			remarkPlugins: [remarkMath], // relevant
			rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex] // relevant
		}),
		image(),
		sitemap(),
	],
});
```

Now, you should make sure that the following stylesheet is referenced. You can reference this anywhere you want, I have a `BlogPost.astro` file that's the base for all my blog posts, which is the only place I'm planning on writing LaTeX, so I have it there.

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.css"
    integrity="sha384-MlJdn/WNKDGXveldHDdyRP1R4CTHr3FeuDNfhsLPYrq2t0UBkUdK2jyTnXPEK1NQ"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

This is it, you can now start writing math that looks good, or just write $\LaTeX$ the cool way.

Thanks for reading, bye now.
