Hi, in this post I'll go through what happens when you compile a program. It's going to involve a little bit of C, Assembly, and some very basic linux tooling. The main idea is that you get out of here with a deeper understanding of what happens behind the scenes.

This type of knowledge is not very useful for most people, but if you like to know how things work, I think you'll enjoy at least some of the things I'll expose here.

I'll do this with Linux in mind, but the same ideas can be transposed to how it works in Windows.

I have taken a lot of inspiration from the **Practical Binary Analysis** book by **No Starch Press**, written by Dennis Andriesse, mainly on how to structure these ideas in a concise way. I highly recommend the book if you want to go deep into binary analysis but keep in mind, it's not a book you'll go through in a weekend, it takes years to master everything in there, but that's beside the point of this post. Let's go!

# Compilation?

Ok, the first step here is to actually understand what compiling a program means.

Computers don't understand code the way we write it; at a deep level, it's all about electrical signals and flip-flops, however, we can go one layer above this and understand that this language can be represented by a series of 0s and 1s, or in other words, **binary**.

To these series of 0s and 1s that the computer understands, we call machine code. As the name implies, this is not something humans can easily read, except for a few wizards who started doing it when dinosaurs were still around.

So, how is it possible that we can write code in a human-readable form so that it can be run by the computer? **Compilation** is the key here. This is essentially the process of converting our hopefully bug-free code into something the machine can understand, i.e.; machine code, or as commonly referred to in the streets, "the binary".

Now, compilation is normally not as simple as taking some C (or other languages) code directly into 0s and 1s. We could do this, but it would be incredibly difficult to maintain the level of progress we have today because we would have to create very complicated software for every single language out there, which is not feasible. So, compiling code is a multi-step process, which I'll go through in this post.

Let's take advantage of a good compiler that comes pre-installed on pretty much all linux distributions, **gcc**, which stands for "The GNU Compiler". By the way, GNU is an actual operating system, based on UNIX, just like Linux!

### Compiling C code

Take this code as an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define FORMAT "%s"
#define PRINTSTRING "Hello World, how's it going?\n"

int main() {
    printf(FORMAT, PRINTSTRING);
}
```

The code above will just print the string "Hello World, how's it going?" to the console.

The line

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

just means "I want you to include the code contained in this library since I'll use it in my program", in this case, the `printf()` function comes from here.

These lines

```c
#define FORMAT "%s"
#define PRINTSTRING "Hello World, how's it going?\n"
```

Are called macros. The important thing is to understand that **they are not actual code that will be run**, but rather things that allow programmers to have a little bit more flexibility when coding. In this case, we're defining a format and the string we want to print as macros. I'll explain why I put those there soon.

The rest of the code

```c
int main() {
    printf(FORMAT, PRINTSTRING);
}
```

is just a normal print to the console. Every language out there has this, so even if you don't know **C**, you can understand the idea (I hope).

If we want to compile this code, all we have to do is (assuming the file name is **main.c**):

```bash
$ gcc main.c -o main
```
```
$ ./main

Hello World, how's it going?
```

That's cool, but if you're reading this post I bet you've already done similar things and this doesn't impress you at all. So let's get deeper in the next sections, to see what's happening under the hood.

### Compilation Steps

When you run that `gcc main.c -o main` line of code, what happens inside is actually extremely complicated and it involves multiple steps. 

The high-level view is as follows:

1) Your **.c** files, alongside any headers, are fed to something called a **Preprocessor**
2) The output of the **Preprocessor** is passed through to the compiler, which will produce assembly code
3) The output of the compiler, that is, the assembly code, is passed to something called an **Assembler**. Here, the output will be one or more object files. These are binaries with executable code (not quite, but close enough).
4) Because we may have multiple object files and/or some external dependencies, these are passed to a **Linker**
5) After linking, you got your final executable!

As an image is worth more than a `0b1111101000` words, below's a diagram for this process.

![compileprocess](/images/gcc-compile.png)

#### Preprocessor

In this step, you feed the Preprocessor **.c** code and the output will still be **.c** code. So, what changes? Well, remember these lines?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define FORMAT "%s"
#define PRINTSTRING "Hello World, how's it going?\n"
```

The preprocessor will **expand** these into the output. Basically, it will insert all the code in the `stdio.h` header file into the output, as well as replace every single usage of `FORMAT` and `PRINTSTRING` by `"%s"` and `"Hello World, how's it going?\n"`, respectively.

We can see this in action using **GCC**, which is why I chose it! I urge you to RTFM with `man gcc`, but all you have to do here is pass the **-E** flag to the compiler, alongside an optional **-P** so the output isn't super verbose.

```bash
$ gcc -E -P main.c
```

Running the line above will print a lot of code to the console, it should look something like this:

```c
...
...
extern int getchar_unlocked (void);
extern int fgetc_unlocked (FILE *__stream);
extern int fputc (int __c, FILE *__stream);
extern int putc (int __c, FILE *__stream);
extern int putchar (int __c);
...
...

int main() {
    printf("%s", "Hello World, how's it going?\n");
}
```

Basically, at the top of the file, you will find a lot of function signatures and type definitions. Those are all from the `stdio.h` header file. You can easily check this by looking into the actual `stdio.h` file on your machine. If you're using linux (which you should), you can find it at **/usr/include/stdio.h**.

Next, remember those macros I mentioned? Look at the `printf()` statement after the **Preprocessor** did its thing and compare it to before. It replaced our `FORMAT` and `PRINTSTRING` with the right stuff, as expected.

So, now you should have a grasp of what preprocessing is, although it does much more, such as taking care of your "preprocessor conditionals", etc... you can read more about this [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_preprocessors.htm).

### Compilation

In this step the **Compiler** will take the output of the **Preprocessor** and turn it into assembly code.
Please note that although we call **GCC** "The Compiler", there's an actual step in there that's technically called **compilation**. I know it's confusing but it is what it is.

We can tell the compiler to give us our assembly code, to do this, just run **GCC** with the **-S** flag, as such:

```bash
$ gcc -S -masm=intel main.c
```

The `-masm=intel` means we want the output to use the **Intel** syntax, as opposed to **AT&T**, for example. This syntax is the simplest to read in my opinion, so I'm using it to illustrate this process.

After running the command above, a new file should emerge, called `main.s`. the **.s** means it's an assembly file, by convention (remember, extensions don't mean much in linux, it's all files).

The output of **main.s** is:

```asm
        .file   "main.c"
        .intel_syntax noprefix
        .text
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "Hello World, how's it going?"
        .text
        .globl  main
        .type   main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        endbr64
        push    rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
        .cfi_offset 6, -16
        mov     rbp, rsp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
        lea     rdi, .LC0[rip]
        call    puts@PLT
        mov     eax, 0
        pop     rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
        ret
        .cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
        .size   main, .-main
        .ident  "GCC: (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0"
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
        .section        .note.gnu.property,"a"
        .align 8
        .long    1f - 0f
        .long    4f - 1f
        .long    5
0:
        .string  "GNU"
1:
        .align 8
        .long    0xc0000002
        .long    3f - 2f
2:
        .long    0x3
3:
        .align 8
4:
```

Now we're talking! There's quite a lot to unpack there. For a very simple primer on assembly you can read a previous blog post of mine on how to write a file like a maniac. There's a section there dedicated to assembly that may be useful. You can find it [here](https://mcaramalho.com/posts/reading-files-1337/#assembly).

The first two lines

```asm
.file   "main.c"
.intel_syntax noprefix
```

are kind of useless to us. The `.file` one is used by the compiler to know the original source file name, which is used by debuggers and the `.intel_syntax noprefix` makes it so the registers don't require the '%' prefix.

I'll briefly go over the rest now, picking some blocks and explaining them (the most relevant)

```asm
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "Hello World, how's it going?"
```

This one is where our constants will reside. The `.section .rodata` stands for "Section Read Only Data", which is where you have data that cannot be changed in runtime (otherwise an exception happens).

The `.LC0` is a compiler-given label, and it's where we're storing said data, in this case, a `.string` with our "Hello ..." value.

Next:

```asm
main:
.LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        endbr64
        push    rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
        .cfi_offset 6, -16
        mov     rbp, rsp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
        lea     rdi, .LC0[rip]
        call    puts@PLT
        mov     eax, 0
        pop     rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
        ret
        .cfi_endproc
```

This is the actual code we wrote in C. We see the `main:` label specifying the program's entry point and the rest of the code below. Special attention to that `call puts@PLT` call that's used with `printf()`. Ignore the **@PLT** part for now, I'll get to it soon.

The rest of the code can be ignored at this stage, but by all means, try to understand it if you want, although that's out of scope for this post.

### Assembler

At this point, after we have our assembly code, we're ready to pass it through the **Assembler**, which will convert that into machine code. The reason we have this step and don't go straight from **C** to **Machine Code** is that assemblers are incredibly difficult, and although converting **C** to **Assembly** is already a daunting task, it makes it easier to have this separated. Why? You may ask... Well, let's say you're creating a new programming language, like **Go**, or **Rust**, or **C++**, all you have to do is to write the means to convert that code into **Assembly**, which is difficult but doable since assembly is "human readable"; then you'd use an assembler to do the rest of the heavy lifting for you.

Remember we still have one step after this, the **Linker**, so that means we can still make the compiler stop at an early stage and spit out what we need. Call **GCC** like this:

```bash
$ gcc main.c -c
```

This will generate a new file called **main.o**, where the **.o** stands for "object file". If you try to read this file you won't be able to, as it's already in a non-readable form (unless you're a machine). You can read its bytes if you're curious, by doing `xxd -l 256 main.o` (on windows, I like **HxD** to read binaries), which will yield the first 256 bytes of the file as hexadecimal output, as such:

```
$ xxd -l 256 main.o

```

You can see that our "Hello World" string is there somehow, which makes sense, but the rest is a bunch of gibberish, impossible to read like this.

When you assemble a file like we just did, you're creating an **ELF** file, which stands for "Executable and Linkable Format". This is the standard linux format for executables, as opposed to the **PE-Format** of Windows. You can see that at the top of the `xxd` output, there's a string specifying "ELF" as the format, but that's not enough. If you want to make sure, you can run the `file` tool, which you should have on any linux distribution, and see what it tells you:

```bash
$ file main.o

main.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
```

Ok, so this tells us that the **Assembler** created an ELF file, with a 64-bit architecture. The **LSB** means "Least Significant Byte", which is just the way numbers will be stored in the program. I'll explain the "not stripped" part in the next section.

Finally, you'll see the word **"relocatable"**. When you run your code, those instructions will be stored in memory, this directive just means that you're dealing with something that can be relocated to any memory address and everything will remain within context, i.e., you're not breaking any assumptions in the code. These **relocatable** files tell you you're dealing with object files that aren't executable per si. Why are these **relocatable** files, well, relocatable? It's quite simple, when you're assembling things into object files, they are all done independently, which means that, if you have a call from the code present in one object file to a function (or other things) of another object file, it has no way of knowing where that address is in memory, therefore, at this stage, these files are all marked as **relocatable**.

The idea here is that at the next stage, we can link all of these files together to build something executable. This includes having all the addresses ready, and so on...

### Linker

Now's the final part, the grand finale where you turn your code into something the world can execute. As this is the last part, we can just run `gcc main.c -o main` to complete everything and give us the final result.

So, let's compile it and see what kind of file we actually got:

```
$ gcc main.c -o main
$ file main

main: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=0dede4223b251bc42cd38d0e83891f06443a0d43, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

Ok, now we have new things to know about. "dynamically linked" is related to the fact we're linking with shared libraries that are usable by everybody. Remember that assembly line we saw above with `call puts@PLT`? Well, that's related to this stage and what I've mentioned about the object files being **relocatable**. **PLT** stands for **Procedure Linkage Table** and all it means is that when linking, these `@PLT` instructions will be replaced with the actual addresses, because at that point, our object files wouldn't know exactly where to go for, in this case, for the `puts()` function from `stdin.h`.

**TLDR on the **PLT** thing: It's there as a stub, so that when the linker gets the object files, it replaces those entries with the right addresses.**

The `interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` just tells us what dynamic linker is used to resolve the shared library code addresses. Remember, this is code that's accessible by everything and everyone on the operating system. 

Finally, you'll see that "not stripped" part as well. This one is very interesting to anyone who wants to learn reverse engineering. When you don't have your executables stripped, all the symbol information will remain intact, which means variable and function names are kept!! This is a godsend when you're trying to figure out what something does, let me illustrate.

Run **xxd** on the executable first, just to see how useless it looks :)

```bash
$ xxd -l 256 main

Well, it's an ELF file alright, but I can't figure out anything about what it does from here.

Let's introduce a new tool, called **readelf**. This tool essentially parses **ELF** files and allows you to get certain information in a structured way. Let's run this with the **--syms** argument to see the symbols of our executable:

```bash
$ readelf --syms main

Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 7 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

The purpose of this post is not to teach you how to read all of this, because that's most likely reserved for another post, however, you can see that now we have some "text" we can interpret. Look at line 36, it clearly shows the filename that originated the **main** executable file. Also, you can see, on line 61, that we have an entry point we're familiar with, the **main()** function, which you can infer from:

```text
61: 0000000000001149    27 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   16 main
```

This means that there's a function (FUNC), of size 27 bytes, that will reside at the address 0x1149 in memory. Besides this entry point, we can see familiar things like the `puts()` symbol on line 49, which tells us that there's probably something being printed out somewhere.

Now, the thing is, when you write a program, you may want to make it hard for people to figure your stuff out and for that, there's "stripping", which will strip the output of these symbols. Without the symbols, things get quite complicated to reverse engineer sometimes, especially on large applications. 

If you want to strip this binary, you can run the following:

```bash
$ strip --strip-all main
```

```bash
$ readelf --syms main

Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 7 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND
     1: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTab
     2: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND puts@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
     3: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
     4: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND __gmon_start__
     5: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND _ITM_registerTMCloneTable
     6: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT  UND __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
```

Yep, good luck with this one, you see it has WAY less information now. You can still see that it calls `puts()` and has a `_start()` function though. By the way, we usually say `main()` is our entry point, but who calls `main()`? That's the job of the `_start()` function!

Linking is way more complicated and contains more "cool things" than what I've shown, but for now, I think you get the gist of it.

### Final product

After linking there's nothing else to do, you now have an executable that you can run, as such:

```bash
./main

Hello World, how's it going?
```

This is it for now, I may do another post in the future where we go through the insides of the object files and see how they "merge" together when linking, but for this one, the idea was to give a brief overview of what happens behind the scenes, at a semi-high level.

If you've made it here, thank you and bye.
