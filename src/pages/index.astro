			Hi there, I'm Marcos, also known on the internet as Rezz. I'm a Software
			Engineer based in Portugal, I'm into all things tech and I'm using this
			blog mostly as a journal. You'll see posts ranging from Programming, to
			Cybersecurity, to IoT or whatever I feel like at the time. If you have any
			requests, you can always hit me up.
			<br />
			In my posts, you won't see a lot of rigor, but rather simple explanations of
			topics, as I learnt them in my head. I'm a believer of simplicity, there's
			no need to have fancy graphics and definitions if one paragraph with an analogy
			will suffice for most cases.
